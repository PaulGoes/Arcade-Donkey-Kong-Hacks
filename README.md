# Arcade Donkey Kong Hacks

This repository contains the various rom hacks that I created of the Arcade Donkey Kong game.

More information can be found on my website: [https://donkeykonghacks.net](https://donkeykonghacks.net).

## Structure and contents

The repository is organized in separate folders for each rom hack.

In a rom hack folder you find the following contents:

- Marquee for the game - the image for the rom hack - usually displayed at the top of the cabinet.
- Design Log for the game - document that captures the design log that was recorded when designing the rom hack.
- Folder ``\Versions Archive\...`` - contains all the intermediate design versions, aka bÃªta versions, of the game.
- Folder ``\MAME Rom\...`` - contains the game rom for use in the MAME emulator.
- Folder ``\HBMAME Rom\...`` - contains the game rom for use in the HomeBrew MAME emulator.
- Folder ``\FBNEO Rom\...`` - contains the game rom for use in the FinalBurn Neo emulator.

> [!NOTE]
> The game is primarily designed and tested using the MAME emulator. So all intermediate design versions only work in the MAME emulator.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all rom hacks have a Design Log. The roms that have no Design Log are: DK Freerun Edition, DK Crazy Barrels, DK Reverse and DK Skip Start.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all rom hacks are supported by FinalBurn Neo. If they are not supported, the ``FBNEO Roms' folder will not exist.
